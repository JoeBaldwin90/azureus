   <h2>
     The mysterious center of all things
   </h2>
   <p>
     A treasure for those who are good. A refuse for those who are not.
   </p>
   <p>
     Beatiful words can be traded, noble deeds can enhance reputations. But if people lack them, why should they be rejected?
   </p>
   <p>
     Nothing can compare to the stillness. Honouring the way.
   </p>
   <p>
     Didn't they say; Through it seekers find, through it the guilty escape?

   <h2>
     Great rising and falling
   </h2>
   <p>
     People only know it exists. Next they see and praise. Soon they fear. Finally they depise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Without fundamental trust, there is no trust at all.
   </p>
   <p>
     Be careful in valuing words. Whenthe work is done, everyone says; we just acted naturally.

   <h2>
     Humans
   </h2>
   <p>
     Are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ten thousand plants and trees are born soft and tender. And die withered and sere.
   </p>
   <p>
    The stiff and strong are death's companions. The soft and weak are life's companions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Therefore,
   </p>
   <p>
    The strongest armies do not conquer. The greatest trees are cut down. The strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up.
